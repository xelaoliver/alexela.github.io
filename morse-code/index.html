            Keyboard input:<br>
            This morse code translator makes it so that (if you are good) it looks like you aren't typing by only using 4 keys at the bottom-right of your keyboard. The keys to type in morse code are:<br><br>

            , - types a dot<br>
            . - types a dash<br>
            / - new character<br>
            shift - backspace<br><br>

            With this, you can type all the alphabet, plus spaces by double-tapping slash.<br><br>

            History:<br>
            Morse Code is a telecommunications method which encodes text into a binary signal that can be decoded by an operator or computer. Morse Code was an invention by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in 1837 to send natural language through electronic pulses. Morse Code impacted Britian and America during World War 1 as it allowed fast and easy communication between people.
            Morse Code is and was easy to use as it only requires a switch (could be an electromechanical solonoid or a mechanical switch), a voltage that stays readable over miles of wire due to wire having <i>a</i> resistance and (well) wire.<br><br>
            The Morse system can also be used to make holes in paper tapes for <i>old-timey</i> computers as Morse Code and Binary Encoding are extremely similar.<br><br>

            I love this encoding system. It is both a real cool thing to know and the greatest invention in telecommunications, so if you want more pages like this with JS demos and some information at the bottom:
