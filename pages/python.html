  A semantic field of programming in a professional and easy language: Python. The first projects I created were simple ASCII character input and output programs like:
  <code>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>Computer: Guess my number, it is between 0-100.
    <p></p>You: 84
    <p></p>Computer: Your guess is a little too low.
    <p></p>You: 92
    <p></p>Computer: Your guess is a little too high.
    <p></p>
  </code>
  And so on until you guess the computer's number.
